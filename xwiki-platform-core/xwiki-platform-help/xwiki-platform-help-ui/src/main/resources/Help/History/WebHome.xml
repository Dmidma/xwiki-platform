&amp;#xd;
A document version is identifier by two numbers, separated by a dot: &amp;lt;Major>.&amp;lt;Minor> (e.g. 3.2). The XWiki versioning system allows the distinction between major and minor edits. When editing a page, the user has the option to decide whether his edit brings major or minor changes to the document. Saving a major version will increase the first component and reset the second to "1", while a minor version will just increase the second component.&amp;#xd;
&amp;#xd;
By default, minor edits do not appear in the document history. The option "Show minor edits" will list all the versions, including minor ones.&lt;/content>
